# Overview

For this project I examined goal scoring among top NHL players. The key questions I wanted to address were:

1. Were goals easier to score in previous years in the NHL?
2. What factors are associated with scoring more goals?
   - Which teams produce more goals?
   - Does goal production decrease with age?
3. Which players have the best shot percentage? Who is the most effectve at scoring goals?

# Data

Data comes from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-03) and is their hockey dataset from 2020.

# Summary

- There was no clear impact of season year on goal production. Therefore, while most of the top record holders finished their careers before 2000, the number of goals has not decreased among the top goal scorers.
- Was unable to look at the teams' impact on goals as this dataset only had the stats for the top peformers.
- Age was associated with goal production with peak goal scoring occuring around age 25 then dropping off.
- Mario Lemieux was the most effecient shooter, taking the fewest shots and having the highest percentage.
